# React Frontend

## Overview

This frontend application is built using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). It provides a user interface for interacting with the backend services.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the frontend application:

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (Node Package Manager)

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
    cd your-repo
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

### Running the Application

1. **Start the Development Server**

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

    The application will be running at `http://localhost:3000`.

2. **Build for Production**

    To create a production build:

    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

    The production-ready files will be in the `build` directory.

### Available Scripts

- **`npm start`**: Runs the app in development mode. The page will reload when you make changes.
- **`npm test`**: Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.
- **`npm run build`**: Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
- **`npm run eject`**: Removes the single build dependency from your project. This is a one-way operation.

### Deployment

1. **Deploy the Build**:

    You can deploy the contents of the `build` directory to any static site hosting service (e.g., GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel).

2. **Configure Environment Variables**:

    If your app requires environment variables, create a `.env` file in the root directory:

    ```env
    REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
    ```

    Replace `http://localhost:5000/api` with your backend API URL.
